									<li><b>Abstract:</b>Recent years have seen a boom in the application of statistical machine learning and deep learning methods to tackle problems in meteorology and climate science. In this talk, I will present three projects ongoing in my group that use machine learning concepts to understand climate variability. I will show how we can use similarity-based networks of climate time series data to reveal new features of intraseasonal variability of extreme rainfall propagation over South Asia in the summer that might potentially be useful for early warning systems of extreme monsoonal rain. I will next present how we can use principal component analysis in combination with Gaussian Mixture Models to categorize extreme phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and show how the Eastern Pacific El Niño is better modeled as two separate categories: a weaker 'canonical' form and an extreme El Niño, both of which show distinct idiosyncratic onset and development. Last, I will present how we can leverage deep learning to develop purely data-driven models for subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasting of the ENSO that are at par with state-of-the-art physics based weather prediction models. Finally, we will briefly talk about what these recent developments mean for understanding and modelling climate variability over the Indian subcontinent.</li>

									<li><b>Title: </b>Revisiting the Economics of Large Language Models with Neural Scaling Laws and Dynamic Sparsity</li>
									<li><b>Speaker:</b> <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/"
											target='_blank'>Anshumali Shrivastava</a>, PhD</li>
									<li><b>Affliation:</b>Assoc. Professor at <a href="https://www.rice.edu/"

									<li><b>Abstract:</b>Neural Scaling Law informally states that increased model size and data automatically improve AI. However, we have reached a point where the growth has reached a tipping end where the cost and energy associated with AI are becoming prohibitive. This talk will demonstrate the algorithmic progress that can exponentially reduce the compute and memory cost of training and inference using "dynamic sparsity" with neural networks. Dynamic sparsity, unlike static sparsity, aligns with Neural Scaling Laws and does not reduce the power of neural networks while reducing the number of FLOPS required by neural models by 99% or more. We will show how data structures, particularly randomized hash tables, can be used to design an efficient "associative memory" that reduces the number of multiplications associated with the training of the neural networks. Current implementations of this idea challenge the common knowledge prevailing in the community that specialized processors like GPUs are significantly superior to CPUs for training large neural networks. The resulting algorithm is orders of magnitude cheaper and energy-efficient. Our careful implementations can train billions of parameter recommendations and Language models on commodity desktop CPUs significantly faster than top-of-the-line TensorFlow alternatives on the most potent A100 GPU clusters, with the same or better accuracies. We will show some demos, including how to train and fine-tune (with rhfl) a billion-parameter language model on a laptop from scratch for search, discovery, and summarization.</li>

									<li><b>Abstract:</b>Cooking is an art. Besides being the basis of nutrition and health, culinary idiosyncrasies are at the core of our cultural identity. Combining and processing raw ingredients to compose delicious dishes is a creative act. However, the increasing availability of data and the advent of computational methods for their scrutiny are dramatically changing the artistic outlook toward gastronomy. The application of data-driven strategies for investigating gastronomic questions has created an all-new paradigm for studying food and cooking. Computational Gastronomy asks questions of culinary origin to seek answers via a structured compilation of data and their analysis. Making food computable will enable data-driven innovations and transform the global food landscape to achieve better public health and nutrition toward a sustainable future.</li>

									<li><b>Abstract:</b> Environmental uncertainties are unavoidable in practice and their worst-case bounds are generally unknown. On the other hand, actuators have hard limits to mechanically or electrically manipulate the variables of interest. This talk presents a computationally tractable approach to implement optimal control algorithms in the presence of bounded actions for systems with limited computational power. In particular, we employ a remote server to solve the underlying optimization problems in a receding horizon fashion and transmit the optimal actions through wireless channels. We shall discuss the key ingredients to design the algorithm, implementation issues and conclude with some data-driven extensions.</li>

									<li><b>Speaker:</b> <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/biplabbose/"

									<li><b>Affliation:</b> Professor at <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/"

									<li><b>Abstract:</b> Once upon a time, Biology was a 'descriptive' subject. We gathered information on different organisms and arranged those systematically. However, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology revolutionized Biology. Now we detect, quantify and manipulate molecules within living systems. Using high-throughput techniques, Biologists are now generating a humongous amount of information. However, information alone is not helpful. We must distill that to develop scientific 'Theories' and 'Laws.' Over decades, scientists across disciplines have attempted to fill this void. They borrowed methods and concepts from Physics and Engineering to understand the "Generalised Design Principles" in living beings. In my talk, I will focus on this approach to Biology. I will argue that the 'Devil' is not in the details of empirical observations but in the underlying physical rules that work across the living and non-living world. I will use examples from different biological phenomena, like gene regulatory circuits and morphogenesis. I will show how simple physical rules and mathematical models help us to understand diverse, complex phenomena in biology.</li>

									<li><b>Abstract:</b> This talk will address multilingual computation, focusing on Machine Translation (MT), in a low-resource setting. Tasks in this area have to grapple with the characteristic problem of disambiguation in the face of resource scarcity, which is the reality for most languages and also arguably for ANY language when it comes to very high-end NLP tasks like, say, 100% disambiguation as demanded by pure interlingua-based MT. Starting with our early work on rule-based MT, we move to our research in Low Resource Machine Translation, covering SMT, NMT, segmenting, pivoting, and semi and unsupervised MT. The findings covered in this talk are based on contributions by many students and researchers over many years, reported in top conferences and journals.</li>

									<li><b>Speaker:</b> <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ayg/"
											target='_blank'>Ananth Grama</a>, PhD</li>
									<li><b>Affliation:</b> Professor at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/"
											target="_blank">Purdue University, USA</a></li>
									<li><b>Abstract:</b> Rapid advances in neuroimaging have resulted in large repositories of images with high temporal and spatial resolution. This has motivated complex connectomic analyses aimed at understanding representation and processing of stimuli . Such analyses require novel computational tools that significantly extend the state-of-the-art in machine learning and data science. These studies have far-reaching implications for the fields of precision psychiatry, behavioural analysis, and neurodegeneration, in addition to applications in AR/VR and advanced human interfaces. In this talk, I will discuss recent work in our group on understanding neuronal response to naturalistic visual stimulus -- I present two methods based on archetypal analysis and deep learning to: (a) find interpretable representations of fMRI response, (b) predict objects in visual frames, and (c) reconstruct visual inputs. I will also briefly describe computational methods to characterize individual-level uniqueness of functional connectomes. I will present methods based on matrix sampling, graph alignment, and linear algebraic techniques to accurately identify the identity of individuals, and the nature of the cognitive task being performed. I will conclude my talk by highlighting the immense significance and challenges posed by problems in the field of neuroimage analyses.</li>

									<li><b>Title:</b> Deep Extreme Mixture Model for Time Series Forecasting</li>
									<li><b>Speaker:</b> <a href="https://sahelybhadra.github.io/index.html"

									<li><b>Affliation:</b> Assistant Professor at <a href="https://iitpkd.ac.in/"

									<li><b>Abstract:</b> Time Series Forecasting (TSF) has been a topic of extensive
										research, which has many real-world applications such as weather prediction,
										stock market value prediction, traffic control etc. Many machine learning models
										have been developed to address TSF, yet, predicting extreme values remains a
										challenge to be effectively addressed. Extreme events occur rarely, but tend to
										cause a huge impact, which makes extreme event prediction important. Assuming
										light tailed distributions, such as Gaussian distribution, on time series data
										does not do justice to the modeling of extreme points. To tackle this issue, we
										develop a novel approach towards improving attention to extreme event
										prediction. Within our work, we model time series data distribution, as a
										mixture of Gaussian distribution and Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). In
										particular, we develop a novel Deep eXtreme Mixture Model (DXtreMM) for
										univariate time series forecasting, which addresses extreme events in time
										series. The model consists of two modules: 1) Variational Disentangled
										Auto-encoder (VD-AE) based classifier and 2) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based
										forecaster units combined with Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) estimators
										for lower and upper extreme values separately. VD-AE Classifier model predicts
										the possibility of occurrence of an extreme event given a time segment, and
										forecaster module predicts the exact value. Through extensive set of experiments
										on real-world datasets we have shown that our model performs well for extreme
										events and is comparable with the existing baseline methods for normal time step
										forecasting.</li>

									<li><b>Title:</b> Learning with Domain Knowledge to Develop Justifiable
										Convolutional Networks</li>
									<li><b>Speaker:</b> <a href="https://nmrinl.github.io/" target='_blank'>Mrinal
											Dasr</a>, PhD</li>
									<li><b>Affliation:</b> Assistant Professor at <a href="https://iitpkd.ac.in/"

									<li><b>Abstract:</b> The inherent structure of the Convolutional Neural Networks
										(CNN) allows them to extract features that are highly correlated with the
										classes while performing image classification. However, it may happen that the
										extracted features are merely coincidental and may not be justifiable from a
										human perspective. For example, from a set of images of cows on grassland, CNN
										can erroneously extract grass as the feature of the class cow. There are two
										main limitations to this kind of learning: firstly, in many false-negative
										cases, correct features will not be used, and secondly, in false-positive cases
										the system will lack accountability. There is no implicit way to inform CNN to
										learn the features that are justifiable from a human perspective to resolve
										these issues. In this paper, we argue that if we provide domain knowledge to
										guide the learning process of CNN, it is possible to reliably learn the
										justifiable features. We propose a systematic yet simple mechanism to
										incorporate domain knowledge to guide the learning process of the CNNs to
										extract justifiable features. The flip side is that it needs additional input.
										However, we have shown that even with minimal additional input our method can
										effectively propagate the knowledge within a class during training. We
										demonstrate that justifiable features not only enhance accuracy but also demand
										less amount of data and training time. Moreover, we also show that the proposed
										method is more robust against perturbational changes in the input images.</li>
