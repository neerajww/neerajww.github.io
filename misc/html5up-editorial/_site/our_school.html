						<h2>What is DS &amp AI?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Today, the amount of data generated through various commercial, financial, medical, academic,
						social and scientific activities is exponential. Data science (DS) is an emerging
						interdisciplinary field that uses scientific approaches to extract insights from various
						datasets. These approaches include inventing methods to gather and create new datasets,
						computationally analyzing them via efficient curation, storage, processing, and visualization,
						and obtaining insights that allow estimating the past, reasoning the present, and predicting the
						future.</p>
					<p>Artificial intelligence (AI), in short, is intelligence demonstrated by machines. But what is
						intelligence? Historically, the traits, such as sensing, perceiving, understanding, and
						responding to the environment, depicted by animals and humans have been associated with
						intelligence. The field of AI deals with developing systematic studies which help understand
						intelligence and, subsequently, model it by developing computational methods to help solve
						challenging problems around us.</p>

					<header class="major">
						<h2>Our Vision</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The AI and Data Science knowledge base constantly evolves with theoretical advancements and
						technological breakthroughs. Newer applications are emerging at a rapid pace. The future
						AI-skilled Workforce will need a different set of knowledge, skills, and competencies, blurring
						the boundaries between other disciplines.</p>
					<blockquote>Setup with support from the <a
							href="https://mehtafamilyfoundation.org/collaborative-programs/the-mehta-family-school-of-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence/"
							target="_blank">Mehta Family Foundation</a> in 2021, the School aims to be a leading place,
						working on creating knowledge by analyzing different kinds of datasets and developing methods to
						engineer intelligence. We adopt an interdisciplinary approach to research with contributions
						from the fields including but not limited to mathematics, electrical engineering, computer
						science, psychology, humanities, chemistry, and biology. With our undergraduate and postgraduate
						programs, we aim to create engineers and researchers ready to take up any data science & AI
						challenge. In this quest, we welcome joining institutes within India and abroad and fostering
						industry collaborations. </blockquote>
