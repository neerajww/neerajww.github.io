									<li><b>Abstract:</b> Environmental uncertainties are unavoidable in practice and their worst-case bounds are generally unknown. On the other hand, actuators have hard limits to mechanically or electrically manipulate the variables of interest. This talk presents a computationally tractable approach to implement optimal control algorithms in the presence of bounded actions for systems with limited computational power. In particular, we employ a remote server to solve the underlying optimization problems in a receding horizon fashion and transmit the optimal actions through wireless channels. We shall discuss the key ingredients to design the algorithm, implementation issues and conclude with some data-driven extensions.</li>

									<li><b>Abstract:</b> Once upon a time, Biology was a 'descriptive' subject. We gathered information on different organisms and arranged those systematically. However, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology revolutionized Biology. Now we detect, quantify and manipulate molecules within living systems. Using high-throughput techniques, Biologists are now generating a humongous amount of information. However, information alone is not helpful. We must distill that to develop scientific 'Theories' and 'Laws.' Over decades, scientists across disciplines have attempted to fill this void. They borrowed methods and concepts from Physics and Engineering to understand the "Generalised Design Principles" in living beings. In my talk, I will focus on this approach to Biology. I will argue that the 'Devil' is not in the details of empirical observations but in the underlying physical rules that work across the living and non-living world. I will use examples from different biological phenomena, like gene regulatory circuits and morphogenesis. I will show how simple physical rules and mathematical models help us to understand diverse, complex phenomena in biology.</li>

									<li><b>Abstract:</b> This talk will address multilingual computation, focusing on Machine Translation (MT), in a low-resource setting. Tasks in this area have to grapple with the characteristic problem of disambiguation in the face of resource scarcity, which is the reality for most languages and also arguably for ANY language when it comes to very high-end NLP tasks like, say, 100% disambiguation as demanded by pure interlingua-based MT. Starting with our early work on rule-based MT, we move to our research in Low Resource Machine Translation, covering SMT, NMT, segmenting, pivoting, and semi and unsupervised MT. The findings covered in this talk are based on contributions by many students and researchers over many years, reported in top conferences and journals.</li>

									<li><b>Title:</b> The Science of Reading Minds: Analyzing Functional Brain Images</li>
									<li><b>Speaker:</b> <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ayg/"
											target='_blank'>Ananth Grama</a>, PhD</li>
									<li><b>Affliation:</b> Professor at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/"
											target="_blank">Purdue University, USA</a></li>
									<li><b>Abstract:</b> Rapid advances in neuroimaging have resulted in large repositories of images with high temporal and spatial resolution. This has motivated complex connectomic analyses aimed at understanding representation and processing of stimuli . Such analyses require novel computational tools that significantly extend the state-of-the-art in machine learning and data science. These studies have far-reaching implications for the fields of precision psychiatry, behavioural analysis, and neurodegeneration, in addition to applications in AR/VR and advanced human interfaces. In this talk, I will discuss recent work in our group on understanding neuronal response to naturalistic visual stimulus -- I present two methods based on archetypal analysis and deep learning to: (a) find interpretable representations of fMRI response, (b) predict objects in visual frames, and (c) reconstruct visual inputs. I will also briefly describe computational methods to characterize individual-level uniqueness of functional connectomes. I will present methods based on matrix sampling, graph alignment, and linear algebraic techniques to accurately identify the identity of individuals, and the nature of the cognitive task being performed. I will conclude my talk by highlighting the immense significance and challenges posed by problems in the field of neuroimage analyses.</li>

									<li><b>Affliation:</b> Assistant Professor at <a href="https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/"

									<li><b>Abstract:</b> Parkinson’s disease is associated with α-synuclein aggregation
										and progressive loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons (SN DA-neurons).
										Precise mechanism(s) behind selective vulnerability of SN DA-neurons to
										α-synuclein aggregation in comparison to ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons
										is not known. Even within SN, DA-neurons in ventro-lateral tier degenerate
										earlier and to a larger extent compared to the neurons in dorso-medial tier. We
										used patch clamp electrophysiology to determine the basis for these differences.
										In my talk, I will walk you through the interesting molecular mechanisms behind
										this process.</li>

									<li><b>Title:</b> Deep Extreme Mixture Model for Time Series Forecasting</li>
									<li><b>Speaker:</b> <a href="https://sahelybhadra.github.io/index.html"
											target='_blank'>Sahely Bhadra</a>, PhD</li>
									<li><b>Affliation:</b> Assistant Professor at <a href="https://iitpkd.ac.in/"

									<li><b>Abstract:</b> Time Series Forecasting (TSF) has been a topic of extensive
										research, which has many real-world applications such as weather prediction,
										stock market value prediction, traffic control etc. Many machine learning models
										have been developed to address TSF, yet, predicting extreme values remains a
										challenge to be effectively addressed. Extreme events occur rarely, but tend to
										cause a huge impact, which makes extreme event prediction important. Assuming
										light tailed distributions, such as Gaussian distribution, on time series data
										does not do justice to the modeling of extreme points. To tackle this issue, we
										develop a novel approach towards improving attention to extreme event
										prediction. Within our work, we model time series data distribution, as a
										mixture of Gaussian distribution and Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). In
										particular, we develop a novel Deep eXtreme Mixture Model (DXtreMM) for
										univariate time series forecasting, which addresses extreme events in time
										series. The model consists of two modules: 1) Variational Disentangled
										Auto-encoder (VD-AE) based classifier and 2) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based
										forecaster units combined with Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) estimators
										for lower and upper extreme values separately. VD-AE Classifier model predicts
										the possibility of occurrence of an extreme event given a time segment, and
										forecaster module predicts the exact value. Through extensive set of experiments
										on real-world datasets we have shown that our model performs well for extreme
										events and is comparable with the existing baseline methods for normal time step
										forecasting.</li>

									<li><b>Title:</b> Learning with Domain Knowledge to Develop Justifiable
										Convolutional Networks</li>
									<li><b>Speaker:</b> <a href="https://nmrinl.github.io/" target='_blank'>Mrinal
											Dasr</a>, PhD</li>
									<li><b>Affliation:</b> Assistant Professor at <a href="https://iitpkd.ac.in/"
											target="_blank"> IIT Palakkad</a></li>
									<li><b>Abstract:</b> The inherent structure of the Convolutional Neural Networks
										(CNN) allows them to extract features that are highly correlated with the
										classes while performing image classification. However, it may happen that the
										extracted features are merely coincidental and may not be justifiable from a
										human perspective. For example, from a set of images of cows on grassland, CNN
										can erroneously extract grass as the feature of the class cow. There are two
										main limitations to this kind of learning: firstly, in many false-negative
										cases, correct features will not be used, and secondly, in false-positive cases
										the system will lack accountability. There is no implicit way to inform CNN to
										learn the features that are justifiable from a human perspective to resolve
										these issues. In this paper, we argue that if we provide domain knowledge to
										guide the learning process of CNN, it is possible to reliably learn the
										justifiable features. We propose a systematic yet simple mechanism to
										incorporate domain knowledge to guide the learning process of the CNNs to
										extract justifiable features. The flip side is that it needs additional input.
										However, we have shown that even with minimal additional input our method can
										effectively propagate the knowledge within a class during training. We
										demonstrate that justifiable features not only enhance accuracy but also demand
										less amount of data and training time. Moreover, we also show that the proposed
										method is more robust against perturbational changes in the input images.</li>
