                                <p>
									The M.Tech. in Data Science at IIT Guwahati is a two-year, full-time postgraduate program aimed at preparing the next generation of data scientists, researchers, and industry leaders. Introduced in 2019, the program was originally a collaborative initiative between the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Mathematics, and Electronics and Electrical Engineering (EEE). Since 2023, the Mehta Family School of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence has taken over the role previously held by the Department of CSE. Together with the Departments of Mathematics and EEE, the program continues to grow and evolve, maintaining its interdisciplinary strength and industry relevance.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The program blends rigorous coursework with hands-on research, equipping students with a deep understanding of data science principles, tools, and real-world applications.
