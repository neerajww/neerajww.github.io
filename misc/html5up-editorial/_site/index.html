							<h3>2022-26 Batch Undergraduates join the School</h3>
							<p>We are delighted to welcome the 2022 batch of BTech students into School of DS&ampAI. They will join hands with the diverse group of faculty, students, and staff of the School in the quest to dive deeper, making an impact to make our world a better place.</p>
							<p>The new joinees come from different parts of India after demonstrating their talents by excelling in the competitive IIT JEE (all India examination). The School hosted an orientation meet for the students on 27 Oct 2022.</p>

							<h3>Reinforcement learning for mobile edge computing system</h3>
							<p>In an Internet of Things (IoT) based network, tasks arriving at individual nodes can be
								processed in-device or at a local Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server. This project
								focuses on the optimal resource allocation problem for tasks arriving in an MEC-based
								IoT network. To address the high complexities of achieving optimality, we aim to develop
								low-complexity task scheduling schemes. Moreover, we aim to adopt Reinforcement Learning
								(RL) based approaches that can learn the optimal policy by interacting with the
								environment. The performance of the RL-based schemes will be evaluated in system-level
								simulators. More details can be found in this <a
									href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9806731>paper</a> on a
								related work of ours, and a presentation on the same is available <a
									href="docs/research/Arghyadip_NCC_2022_slides.pdf">here</a>.</p>

							<h3>Analysis of facial tissue movements using AI</h3>
							<p>The eye and facial movements are important to humans because they convey subtle
								information about a personâ€™s mental state (e.g., attention, intention, emotion) and
								physical state (e.g., age, health, fatigue). These movements, which generate facial
								expressions, are carefully scrutinized by humans in social settings. In our lab, we are
								focused on developing Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems for measuring,
								modeling, and animating eye gaze and facial tissue deformations for applications in
								healthcare and computer animation. We use high frame rate vision systems to capture
								human faces and apply data-driven approaches to analyze and model facial expressions. In
								the healthcare sector, facial movement analysis can be used to develop tools for rapid
								assessments of mental health and to build patient-computer interaction systems. In
								computer graphics, we can create real-time and hyper-realistic computer-generated
								animations of human eyes and faces in creating convincing and interactive animation
								characters.</p>
