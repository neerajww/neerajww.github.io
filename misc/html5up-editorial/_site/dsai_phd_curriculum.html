										<h2>PhD Programme</h2>
									</header>
									<p>At the School of DS&AI, we believe that PhD Scholars flourish in a flexible environment that values their unique backgrounds and experiences. We are committed to offering courses that expand their knowledge, fuel their curiosity, and empower them to ask thought-provoking "why" and "why not" questions. Moreover, we actively encourage interdisciplinary exploration, recognizing the immense value it brings to their research journey.
									</p>
									<p>While a PhD Scholar pursue their course work, they will be matched with an advisor based primarily on mutual research interests. We also believe that it's vital for advisors and students to work as peers, and if desired, a student can work with more than one faculty member during their time in IIT Guwahati.
									</p>
									<p>The PhD Scholars have the option to receive financial support as stipend from the Ministry of Education, India or Project Funding from their Advisors or different PhD Fellowships awarded by the Institute, while in good academic standing. Further, we also have sponsored, part-time, external and self-financed options for pursuing a PhD. You can find more information <a href="https://iitg.ac.in/acad/admission/doctoral/studentship.php">here</a>.
									</p>
                                    <h3>Join us for a deep dive into DS&ampAI research and development, and design impactful soutions to challenging problems.</h3>
									<p>Unlike Bachelors and Masters degrees, duration of a PhD Programme is variable. We encourage students to graduate within a time window of five years, and how sooner it happens is dependent on the progress and completion of the research. Candidates with BTech or MTech or MSc degrees are encouraged to apply to the program.
