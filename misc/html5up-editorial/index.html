							<h3>School of DS&AI Welcomes 2022 Batch of BTech Students, Expanding Capacity and Igniting a Quest for Impact</h3>
							<p>We are thrilled to extend a warm welcome to the incoming batch of BTech students for the year 2022 at the School of DS&AI. These students will join us as we collectively strive to explore deeper and create a positive impact on our world. The new students have come from various regions across India, having demonstrated their exceptional talents by excelling in the competitive IIT JEE (All India examination). To familiarize them with the School and its programs, an orientation meet was organized on 27th October 2022. It is worth mentioning that this year, the School has expanded its intake capacity from twenty students in 2021 to thirty students, enabling us to accommodate more aspiring individuals.</p>

							<h3>Reinforcement learning for mobile edge computing system</h3>
							<p>In an Internet of Things (IoT) based network, tasks arriving at individual nodes can be
								processed in-device or at a local Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server. This project, led by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/arghyadiproy/home" target="_blank">Arghyadip Roy</a>,
								focuses on the optimal resource allocation problem for tasks arriving in an MEC-based
								IoT network. To address the high complexities of achieving optimality, the aim is to develop
								low-complexity task scheduling schemes. Additionally, reinforcement learning
								(RL) based approaches will be developed that can learn the optimal policy by interacting with the
								environment. The performance of the RL-based schemes will be evaluated in system-level
								simulators. More details can be found in this <a
									href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9806731>paper</a> on a
								related work of ours, and a presentation on the same is available <a

							<h3>Analysis of facial tissue movements using AI</h3>
							<p>The eye and facial movements convey subtle
								information about a person’s mental state (e.g., attention, intention, emotion) and
								physical state (e.g., age, health, fatigue). These movements, which generate facial
								expressions, are carefully scrutinized by humans in social settings. <a href="https://debanga.github.io" target="_blank">Debanga Raj Neog's</a> lab is focussing on developing Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems for measuring,
								modeling, and animating eye gaze and facial tissue deformations for applications in
								healthcare and computer animation. The idea is to use high frame rate vision systems to capture
								human faces, and apply data-driven approaches to analyze and model facial expressions. In
								the healthcare sector, facial movement analysis can be used to develop tools for rapid
								assessments of mental health and to build patient-computer interaction systems. In
								computer graphics, it can help in creating real-time and hyper-realistic computer-generated
								animations of human eyes and faces in creating convincing and interactive animation
								characters. For more information <a href="https://debanga.github.io/projects" target='_blank'>click here</a>.</p>
