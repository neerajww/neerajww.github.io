Although a digital beamformer is used conventionally, due to the high associated cost and power requirements, a hybrid beamforming architecture is being widely considered. Robust communication using beams necessitates proper beam management protocols. We explore the utility of machine learning algorithms in light of such challenges. Supervised and reinforcement learning algorithms have been explored to speed up the selection process of spatial beams to maximize the mean data rate of a multi-antenna wireless system that implements hybrid beamforming in mmWave frequency bands. In this talk, we will discuss our ongoing research works being carried out in this direction

                                                            Machine learning methods (especially the deep learning models) rely on large datasets: the more the data, the better the learning. However, storing large datasets and training models on them becomes significantly more expensive. Some of the applications such as continual learning need to train or fine-tune the models frequently, making it a computationally demanding exercise. In this talk, we will briefly discuss the following questions in the context of deep learning: (i) Are all the data samples equally important for learning? (ii) Can we identify a subset of the training data for learning the model that is as good as (or, close to) the one learned on the full dataset? (iii) Can we distill the large dataset into a smaller but synthetic dataset for compute-efficient training? We will discuss some of the works that attempt subset selection and dataset distillation (or, condensation) toward compute-efficient learning.

                                                            Since the outbreak of COVID-19, an increasing number of studies have suggested that the disease triggers the SARS-CoV-2 virus to replicate and migrate down the respiratory tract, to the epithelial cells in the lungs. Meta-analysis studies have found fever, followed by cough, and malaise as the common symptoms in COVID-19 infected individuals. Altogether this indicates impairment in the respiratory system. Hence, it becomes interesting to understand if there are detectable signatures of COVID-19 in the sound samples such as breathing, cough, and speech, originating from the respiratory system. Presence of detectable COVID-19 signatures in sound samples can subsequently be used to design point-of-care tests. These will be easily scalable and cost-effective, supplementing the gold-standard RT-PCR and other molecular testing methods. To explore this, we pursued an exploratory study consisting of respiratory sound sample dataset creation, acoustic analysis of the data using signal processing and machine learning approaches, and development of a COVID-19 screening tool. We find that significantly above chance COVID-19 detection performance (AUC-ROC>80%) is obtained using sound recordings, and the performance improves on using symptom information. In this talk, I will present this exploration in detail. [This is a joint work with individuals from multiple places across India who joined hands, remotely, during the pandemic].

LipForensics targets high-level semantic irregularities in mouth movements, which are common in many generated videos. It consists of first pretraining a Spatio-temporal network to perform visual speech recognition (lipreading), thus learning-rich internal representations related to natural mouth motion. A temporal network is subsequently finetuned on fixed mouth embeddings of real and forged data in order to detect fake videos based on mouth movements without overfitting to low-level, manipulation-specific artifacts.

                                                            In the regret-based formulation of Multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problems, except in rare instances, much of the literature focuses on arms with i.i.d. rewards. In this talk, we consider the problem of obtaining regret guarantees for MAB problems in which the rewards of each arm form a Markov chain that may not belong to a single parameter exponential family. To achieve logarithmic regret in such problems is not difficult: a variation of standard Kullback-Leibler Upper Confidence Bound (KL-UCB) does the job. However, the constants obtained from such an analysis are poor for the following reason: i.i.d. rewards are a special case of Markov rewards and it is difficult to design an algorithm that works well independent of whether the underlying model is truly Markovian or i.i.d. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm that identifies whether the rewards from each arm are truly Markovian or i.i.d. using a total variation distance-based test. Our algorithm then switches from using a standard KL-UCB to a specialized version of KL-UCB when it determines that the arm reward is Markovian, thus resulting in low regret for both i.i.d. and Markovian settings.

                                                            Deep Learning often requires a huge amount of training data to learn sophisticated models. Considering the human expertise and the computational resources required, the resulting models become valuable intellectual property to be protected by the researchers. In this talk, I will discuss the risks of exposing such models or their predictions to adversaries. Specifically, I will discuss a couple of directions for extracting knowledge from the trained models that amount to stealing the victim model's knowledge. Starting from very simplistic scenarios, I will take you towards the risks present in a real-world 'ML as a service (MLaaS)' deployment scenario.
