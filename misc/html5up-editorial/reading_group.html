											Parametric modeling of periodic phenomena has received a great deal of attention in signal processing literature. The aim of signal processing is to recover important characteristics of the underlying phenomenon from the observed signal. Due to the random nature of these signals, Statistics plays an important role in model formulation, estimation, and data analysis. In this talk, I would like to discuss two fundamental models that have been studied extensively in the statistical signal-processing literature. Furthermore, we will discuss different methods for parameter estimation and their advantages and limitations.

											Information Theory and Probability Theory are two sides of a coin. While Probability Theory enables us to model a problem mathematically by estimating the unknown value of a Random Variable or a parameter through its inference technique, the Information Theory allows us to capture exactly the amount of uncertainty that the Random Variable conveys. The first instance of this notion is Shannon’s Entropy H(X) for a random variable X. Without any other information about X, there is an uncertainty about X. Cryptography Theory, the science of maintaining secrets and honesty in protocols started its journey with the hand of Information and Coding Theory. Shannon wrote his first paper “Mathematical Theory of Communication” in 1948 where he modeled the process or techniques of secure communication by adopting his notions of Information Theory. Information Theoretic Cryptography seeks to establish cryptographic protocols that are information theoretically secure against adversaries with infinitesimal computational feasibility. In this talk we shall discuss how we can transmit a message or a data securely or privately over an insecure or public channel with the help of Information Theory.

											Retinal fundus images provide valuable diagnostic and clinical information for the diagnosis of ophthalmologic diseases such as Glaucoma and Diabetic Retinopathy. In particular, analysis of retinal blood vessels using computational models can assist in the diagnosis by quantifying the thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer and the alterations in structural appearances. In this talk, we will discuss our recent research work that proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN) for retinal vessel segmentation from fundus images. The proposed GAN architecture consists of the generator as a segmentation network and the discriminator as a classification network. The generator is a multi-scale residual convolutional neural network with skip connections, while the discriminator is a vision transformer that acts as a binary classifier. The inception module in the generator extracts multi-scale features of blood vessel segments and is able to capture fine details in the vessel segments. The discriminator consists of stacked self-attention networks and position-wise fully connected feed-forward networks. The attention mechanism in the transformer is competent in preserving both global and local information while acting as a discriminator. The efficacy of the proposed method has been evaluated on publicly available DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, HRF, ARIA, IOSTAR, and RC-SLO datasets.

											These days machine learning is being used very widely in a lot of high
											stakes decision making areas like healthcare, law, business etc. But the
											main problem with these machine learning models is that they are mostly
											black boxes. Although for interpreting these black box models we can use
											either rule-based explanation techniques or different popular post hoc model
											agnostic explanations techniques like LIME and SHAP. In this talk, we will
											discuss about the framework that can effectively hide the discriminatory
											biases of any black box classifier by fooling LIME and SHAP, due to which
											these post hoc explanation techniques might be unstable and unreliable which
											result in misleading explanations. There has not been much prior work to
											understand the real-world consequences of misleading explanations. So, we
											will also look into it that how misleading explanations can affect user
											trust. We will also discuss how can adversarial perturbation based post hoc
											techniques to generate any arbitrary explanation of their choice.

											Current cellular systems employ narrow spatial beams using high-dimensional
											antenna arrays (massive MIMO) to serve multiple users simultaneously.
											Although a digital beamformer is used conventionally, due to the high
											associated cost and power requirements, a hybrid beamforming architecture is
											being widely considered. Robust communication using beams necessitates
											proper beam management protocols. We explore the utility of machine learning
											algorithms in light of such challenges. Supervised and reinforcement
											learning algorithms have been explored to speed up the selection process of
											spatial beams to maximize the mean data rate of a multi-antenna wireless
											system that implements hybrid beamforming in mmWave frequency bands. In this

											Machine learning methods (especially the deep learning models) rely on large
											datasets: the more the data, the better the learning. However, storing large
											datasets and training models on them becomes significantly more expensive.
											Some of the applications such as continual learning need to train or
											fine-tune the models frequently, making it a computationally demanding
											exercise. In this talk, we will briefly discuss the following questions in
											the context of deep learning: (i) Are all the data samples equally important
											for learning? (ii) Can we identify a subset of the training data for
											learning the model that is as good as (or, close to) the one learned on the
											full dataset? (iii) Can we distill the large dataset into a smaller but
											synthetic dataset for compute-efficient training? We will discuss some of
											the works that attempt subset selection and dataset distillation (or,
											condensation) toward compute-efficient learning.

											Since the outbreak of COVID-19, an increasing number of studies have
											suggested that the disease triggers the SARS-CoV-2 virus to replicate and
											migrate down the respiratory tract, to the epithelial cells in the lungs.
											Meta-analysis studies have found fever, followed by cough, and malaise as
											the common symptoms in COVID-19 infected individuals. Altogether this
											indicates impairment in the respiratory system. Hence, it becomes
											interesting to understand if there are detectable signatures of COVID-19 in
											the sound samples such as breathing, cough, and speech, originating from the
											respiratory system. Presence of detectable COVID-19 signatures in sound
											samples can subsequently be used to design point-of-care tests. These will
											be easily scalable and cost-effective, supplementing the gold-standard
											RT-PCR and other molecular testing methods. To explore this, we pursued an
											exploratory study consisting of respiratory sound sample dataset creation,
											acoustic analysis of the data using signal processing and machine learning
											approaches, and development of a COVID-19 screening tool. We find that
											significantly above chance COVID-19 detection performance (AUC-ROC>80%) is
											obtained using sound recordings, and the performance improves on using
											symptom information. In this talk, I will present this exploration in
											detail. [This is a joint work with individuals from multiple places across
											India who joined hands, remotely, during the pandemic].

										<div id="talk_2" class="collapse">
											In the regret-based formulation of Multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problems, except
											in rare instances, much of the literature focuses on arms with i.i.d.
											rewards. In this talk, we consider the problem of obtaining regret
											guarantees for MAB problems in which the rewards of each arm form a Markov
											chain that may not belong to a single parameter exponential family. To
											achieve logarithmic regret in such problems is not difficult: a variation of
											standard Kullback-Leibler Upper Confidence Bound (KL-UCB) does the job.
											However, the constants obtained from such an analysis are poor for the
											following reason: i.i.d. rewards are a special case of Markov rewards and it
											is difficult to design an algorithm that works well independent of whether
											the underlying model is truly Markovian or i.i.d. To overcome this issue, we
											introduce a novel algorithm that identifies whether the rewards from each
											arm are truly Markovian or i.i.d. using a total variation distance-based
											test. Our algorithm then switches from using a standard KL-UCB to a
											specialized version of KL-UCB when it determines that the arm reward is
											Markovian, thus resulting in low regret for both i.i.d. and Markovian
											settings.
