							<h3>2022-26 Batch Undergraduates join the School</h3>
							<p>The curious minds have arrived! We are delighted to welcome the 2022 batch of BTech
								students into School of DS & AI. They will join hands with the diverse group of faculty,
								students, and staff of the School in the quest to dive deeper into Data Science &amp AI,
								making an impact to make our world a better place.</p>
							<p>The new joinees come from different parts of India after demonstrating their talents by
								excelling in the competitive JEE all India examination. The School hosted an orientation
								meet for the students on 27 Oct 2022.</p>

							<h3>Reinforcement learning for mobile edge computing system</h3>
							<p>In an Internet of Things (IoT) based network, tasks arriving at individual nodes can be
								processed in-device or at a local Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server. This project
								focuses on the optimal resource allocation problem for tasks arriving in an MEC-based
								IoT network. To address the high complexities of achieving optimality, we aim to develop
								low-complexity task scheduling schemes. Moreover, we aim to adopt Reinforcement Learning
								(RL) based approaches that can learn the optimal policy by interacting with the
								environment. The performance of the RL-based schemes will be evaluated in system-level
								simulators. More details can be found in this <a
									href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9806731>paper</a> on a
								related work of ours, and a presentation on the same is available <a

							<h3>Analysis of facial tissue movements using AI</h3>
							<p>The eye and facial movements are important to humans because they convey subtle
								information about a person’s mental state (e.g., attention, intention, emotion) and
								physical state (e.g., age, health, fatigue). These movements, which generate facial
								expressions, are carefully scrutinized by humans in social settings. In our lab, we are
								focused on developing Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems for measuring,
								modeling, and animating eye gaze and facial tissue deformations for applications in
								healthcare and computer animation. We use high frame rate vision systems to capture
								human faces and apply data-driven approaches to analyze and model facial expressions. In
								the healthcare sector, facial movement analysis can be used to develop tools for rapid
								assessments of mental health and to build patient-computer interaction systems. In
								computer graphics, we can create real-time and hyper-realistic computer-generated
								animations of human eyes and faces in creating convincing and interactive animation
								characters.</p>

							<h3>Campus gets another supercomputer</h3>
							<p>Named "Param Kamrup", this is a 838 Terra FLOPS super computer with 107 CPU nodes, 10 GPU
								nodes, 9 high memory nodes, 740 CPU cores, and several CUDA cores. Our data scientists
								are getting ready to crunch numbers with these machines! To know about the HPC facility
								in campus check <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/param-ishan/" target="_blank">here.</p>
