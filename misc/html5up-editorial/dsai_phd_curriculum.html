										<h2>PhD Program</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In the School of Data Science &amp AI, we believe that PhD Scholars thrive in a flexible environment that considers their background and experience, provides courses growing their understanding and fuelling the curiosity to ask <i>why</i> and <i>why not</i> questions, and encourages interdisciplinary exploration.
									</p>
									<p>While you pursue your course work, you'll be matched with an advisor based primarily on mutual research interests and begin a research project. We also believe that it's vital for advisors and students to work as peers, and the flexibility of our programs encourages students to often work with more than one faculty member and many other students during their time in IIT Guwahati.
									</p>
									<p>The PhD Scholars have the option to receive full financial support from MHRD (or project funding) or different fellowships while in good academic standing, which helps ensure freedom to explore regardless of funding hurdles. Further, we also have sponsored, part-time,  external and self-financed options for pursuing a PhD. You can find more information <a href="https://iitg.ac.in/acad/admission/doctoral/studentship.php">here</a>.
									</p>
                                    <h3>Join us for a deep dive into DS &amp AI, and design solutions which will make an impact.</h3>
									<p>Unlike Bachelors and Masters degrees, duration of a PhD program is variable. We expect students to graduate within a time window of 5 years, and how sooner it happens is dependent on the progress and completion of the research. Candidates with Btech or MTech or M. Sc. degrees are encouraged to apply to the program. To check the details about PhD admissions <a href="https://iitg.ac.in/acad/admission/">click here</a>.</p>
