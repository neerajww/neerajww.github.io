            Hi! I am Neeraj Sharma, a Research Scholar, pursuing my PhD in <a href="http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in">ECE</a>
            at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.
            I joined <a href="http://www.iisc.ernet.in">Indian Institute of Science (IISc)</a> in 2009 after completing a B.Tech in Instrumentation and Electronics Engineering
            from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Engineering_and_Technology,_Bhubaneswar">College of Engineering and Technology</a>, Bhubaneswar.
            My interests are in signal sampling, and reconstruction, transform-domain analysis,
            and pattern recognition. My research is focussed
            on obtaining an information reconstruction methodology with a flavour motivated from signal to neural transduction mechanism
            in mammalian hearing. Focus is on 1-D signals, and more specifically audio signals. The goal here is not perfect signal
            reconstruction but perfect information reconstruction. This brings the interesting issue of sampling the
            information of interest in the signal rather than sampling the whole signal. We (I with <a href="http://www.sagiisc.in/people/faculty">
            Prof. TV Sreenivas</a>, my advisor) think this is how it may be happening when we hear!

  			    Auditory motivated signal sampling and representation techniques:
  			    Application to efficient analog-to-information conversion
			    Sound is a stimuli which has been studied scientifically and modeled mathematically.
			    The efforts have been quite successful when we look at the way our voice is transmitted for
			    communication or music processing is done in studios based on these principles. However, the
			    many tasks such as speech recognition, language learning, sound mixture segregation remain open
			    problems for machine implementation and also speech processing through cochlear implants is far
			    from satisfactory. We attempt to learn from the way mammalian auditory system performs signal
			    processing and pattern recognition. The biological signal processing aspects are nonlinear and
			    do not in general fall into the paradigm of linear time-invariant systems analysis.
			    The performance (of the task performed) shows a graceful degradation with noise.
			    With this motivation we are focusing on issue of efficient sampling, reconstruction, representation
			    and coding of audio signals. In this research, we are exploring the following sub-topics which could
			    yield new techniques for information and signal reconstruction with focus on auditory processing like
			    representations.
    A. sparse representation (for example compressive sampling) based reconstruction,
    B. random sub-Nyquist, event-triggered sampling
    C. noise assisted signal processing (example using stochastic resonance)
            <p>A Doctoral Thesis ... a body of research that, in a small way, will move a field forward.</p>

				      <dd>The classical approach to A/D conversion has been uniform sampling and we get perfect reconstruction for
				      bandlimited signals by satisfying the Nyquist Sampling Theorem. We propose a non-uniform sampling scheme based on level crossing
				      (LC) time information. We show stable reconstruction of bandpass signals with correct scale factor and hence a unique reconstruction
				      from only the non-uniform time information. For reconstruction from the level crossings we make use of the sparse reconstruction
				      based optimization by constraining the bandpass signal to be sparse in its frequency content. While overdetermined system of equations
				      is resorted to in the literature we use an undetermined approach along with sparse reconstruction formulation. We could get a
				      reconstruction SNR >20dB and perfect support recovery with probability close to 1, in noise-less case and with lower probability
				      in the noisy case. Random picking of LC from different levels over the same limited signal duration and for the same length of
				      information, is seen to be advantageous for reconstruction.</dd>

				      <dd>We propose data acquisition from continuous-time signals belonging to the class of real-valued trigonometric polynomials using
				      an event-triggered sampling paradigm. The sampling schemes proposed are: level crossing (LC), close to extrema LC, and extrema sampling.
				      Analysis of robustness of these schemes to jitter, and bandpass additive gaussian noise is presented. In general these sampling schemes
				      will result in non-uniformly spaced sample instants. We address the issue of signal reconstruction from the acquired data-set by imposing
				      structure of sparsity on the signal model to circumvent the problem of gap and density constraints. The recovery performance is contrasted
				      amongst the various schemes and with random sampling scheme. In the proposed approach, both sampling and reconstruction are non-linear
				      operations, and in contrast to random sampling methodologies proposed in compressive sensing these techniques may be implemented
				      in practice with low-power circuitry.</dd>

				      <dd>Estimating the parameters of moving sound sources using only the source signal is of interest in low-power, and contact-less source monitoring
			      applications, such as, industrial robotics and bio-acoustics. The received signal embeds the motion attributes of the source via Doppler effect.
			      In this paper, we analyze the Doppler effect on mixture of time-varying sinusoids. Focusing, on the instantaneous frequency (IF) of the received
			      signal, we show that the IF profile composed of IF and its first two derivatives can be used to obtain source motion parameters. This requires
			      a smooth estimate of IF profile. However, the numerical implementation of traditional approaches, such as analytic signal and energy separation
			      approach, gives oscillatory behavior hence a non-smooth IF estimate. We devise an algorithm using non-uniformly spaced signal extrema samples
			      of the received signal for smooth IF profile estimation. Using the smooth IF profiles for a source moving on a linear trajectory with constant
			      velocity, an accurate estimate of moving source parameters is obtained. We see promise of this approach for an arbitrary trajectory motion
			      parameter estimation.</dd>

				      <dd>The inner ear has been shown to characterize an acoustic stimuli by transducing fluid motion in the inner ear to mechanical bending
			      of stereocilia on the inner hair cells (IHCs). The excitation motion/energy transferred to an IHC is dependent on the frequency spectrum
			      of the acoustic stimuli, and the spatial location of the IHC along the length of the basilar membrane (BM). Subsequently, the afferent
			      auditory nerve fiber (ANF) bundle samples the encoded waveform in the IHCs by synapsing with them. In this work we focus on sampling of
			      information by afferent ANFs from the IHCs, and show computationally that sampling at specific time instants is sufficient for decoding
			      of time-varying acoustic spectrum embedded in the acoustic stimuli. The approach is based on sampling the signal at its zero-crossings
			      and higher-order derivative zero-crossings. We show results of the approach on time-varying acoustic spectrum estimation from cricket
			      call signal recording. The framework gives a time-domain and non-spatial processing perspective to auditory signal processing. The approach
			      works on the full band signal, and is devoid of modeling any bandpass filtering mimicking the BM action. Instead, we motivate the approach
			      from the perspective of event-triggered sampling by afferent ANFs on the stimuli encoded in the IHCs. Though the approach gives acoustic
			      spectrum estimation but it is shallow on its complete understanding for plausible bio-mechanical replication with current mammalian auditory
			      mechanics insights.</dd>

				      <dd>Event-triggered sampling (ETS) is a new approach towards efficient signal analysis. The goal of ETS need
				 not be only signal reconstruction, but also direct estimation of desired information in the signal by skillful
				 design of event. We show a promise of ETS approach towards better analysis of oscillatory non-stationary
				  signals modeled by a time-varying sinusoid, when compared to existing uniform Nyquist-rate sampling
				  based signal processing. We examine samples drawn using ETS, with events as zero-crossing (ZC), level-
				  crossing (LC), and extrema, for additive in-band noise and jitter in detection instant. We find that extrema
				  samples are robust, and also facilitate instantaneous amplitude (IA), and instantaneous frequency (IF)
				  estimation in a time-varying sinusoid. The estimation is proposed solely using extrema samples, and a local
				  polynomial regression based least-squares fitting approach. The proposed approach shows improvement, for
				  noisy signals, over widely used analytic signal, energy separation, and ZC based approaches (which are based
				  on uniform Nyquist-rate sampling based data-acquisition and processing). Further, extrema based ETS in
				  general gives a sub-sampled representation (relative to Nyquist-rate) of a time-varying sinusoid. For the
				  same data-set size captured with extrema based ETS, and uniform sampling, the former gives much better
				  IA and IF estimation.</dd>
