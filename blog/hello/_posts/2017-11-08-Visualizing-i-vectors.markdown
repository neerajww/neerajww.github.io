**Step 1: Dataset**
We will use a publicly available dataset in this excercise.
We will like to a have large number of talkers and a good duration of speech from each talker.
It will be good to have clean speech files as we are interested in analyzing the feature extraction and not noise robutness of these features.
With this things in mind, a good dataset is the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.



Step 2: Data preparation

Step 3: Feature Extraction

Step 4: i-vector Extraction

Step 5: Visualizing the learn space

We will try to make a very basic setup for speech signal to ivector pipeline. 
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
  end
  print_hi('Tom')
  #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
  {% endhighlight %}
